# ðŸ¤– Local LLM Agent with LM Studio & DuckDuckGo Search

This project showcases a simple, local-first reasoning agent that interacts with a large language model (LLM) running in **LM Studio**, and optionally performs real-time web searches using **DuckDuckGo**. The agent follows a reasoning loop inspired by the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework.

## Features

- Local inference using LM Studio and a GGUF model (e.g. Mistral 7B).
- ReAct-style loop: Thought â†’ Action â†’ Observation â†’ Final Answer.
- Action execution via DuckDuckGo search API.
- Simple regex-based action parsing from LLM responses.
- Up to 5 cycles per run.

## How to Run

1. **Install Python dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
2. Make sure LM Studio is running at http://localhost:1234 with the model loaded (e.g. mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_0).
3. Run the agent script:
```bash
python agent.py
```

4. Enter your task or question when prompted:
```css
What are the top programming languages in 2025?
```
# Example Output

The agent will reason about your input, perform actions like web search, and return a final answer.

```vbnet
Task: What is the capital of Japan?

Thought: I need to find the capital city of Japan.
Action [capital of Japan]
Observation: The capital of Japan is Tokyo.
Final Answer: Tokyo.
```
